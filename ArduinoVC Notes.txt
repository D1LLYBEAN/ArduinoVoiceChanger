Problems and potential fixes:
Sound Feedback from the speaker to the mic.
	fix during physical design stage.
Voltage offset on the mic (good, but below center).
	achieve a dc offset of 510? so it can scale in both directions evenly before clipping (0 and 1023).
	add static value to readings?
Mic maxes out easily.
	voltage divieder?
Mic does positive and negative sound (goes above and below a static DC).

Notes:
There appears to be nothing wrong on the Arduino side.
	when supplying a sine wave to the analog input, it appears to sample correctly.
		when the speaker high/low is set up right, it outputs reasonably.
	the circular register appears to be working properly, with pointers moving at different speeds.
		there is minimal crackle when the registers overlap.
		when the speaker high/low is set up right, the output is slowed
	we may need a different method for determining when the speaker is supplied a high or low.
		ideally, we would have variable voltages, but pwm won't work in this case.
Without anything plugged in, there is noise (min: 0, max: 50-150).
With just mic plugged in (3.3V supply, fairly quiet room), there is noise (min: ~330, max: ~340).

Ideas:
Have the speaker react to local peak voltages, instead of reacting to a chane in amplitude between samples
	high when signal crosses margin (10%?) above DC offset.
	low wheh signal crosses margin (10%?) below DC offset.
	requires knowledge of DC offset, which may not be consistent.
